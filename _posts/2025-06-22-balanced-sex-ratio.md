India is currently facing a demographic challenge with its declining sex ratio at birth.
According to the SRS Statistical Report 2023, the sex ratio has dropped to 929 girls per 1000 boys.
This imbalance poses not only a social issue but a long-term economic risk.

### Key Points:
- Government data shows alarming trends.
- Social insecurity increases among young men.
- Economic productivity is affected due to unequal gender representation.

We must address this issue through awareness, policy reform, and equal opportunity initiatives.
